# API main functionality

## Routes

* We have two main routes
* /wordsList (GET). returns list of words
* /rank (POST) . takes a score and returns a rank

## Server
* I'm using express with nodejs

## Folder structure
We can reform the folder structure based on the type of the project but since this is a small one we can use only one file for convenience

* app.js contains all the logic
* TestData.json contains the words list
